Git is a version control System.
* It can help take record of changes you make to your project files.
* The advantage of this is that multiple people can work on the same project at the same time. All people are aware of the changes we made.
* Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
* Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
* You can revert back to any previous commit.

# Branches and git.
* We create a master branch of a project.
* Add new feature to the project So we create a new branch and do the work.
* After developing the feet that feature, we can merge both branches and Master branch will have that feature now.

# Stash in git
* When you don't want to commit something, you stash it and get will provide you a branch
with no local uncommented changes and you can comment restore that stash anytime
